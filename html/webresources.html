Summary: <br />
W3Schools is an information website that offers tutorials for most 
programing and web development languages, as well as quick references and examples
for anything you want to do with those languages. It also offers a "try it yourself"
feature that allows you to have a guided practice and test out code and its 
implementation on the website itself. <br />
Review: <br />
W3Schools is great, it is easily accessible and navigable, and I can find 
a tutorial or reference for anything i'm looking for very quickly. The tutorials
are also very informative and offer explanations that aren't overcomplicated or hard 
to follow. <br />

The Mozilla Developer Network (MDN) is an open source collaborative effort 
made to provide quick references and guides to developers focusing mostly on

<br />
Review: <br />
MDN is really good for what it focuses on, being HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 
It is also really great for diagnosing errors that come up. The AI Help feature
is new but it is really good at diagnosing problems for anything HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.<br />

<a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/">The Odin Project</a><br />
Summary: <br />
The Odin Project is a free open source coding curriculum that can teach 
anyone that wants to learn how to be a Full Stack JavaScript Developer.<br />
Review: <br />
The Odin Project is fantastic, and offers a wholistic curriculum to teach you 
how to be a web developer. It teaches you not only how to code, but even offers 
advice and tips on how to get a job and all of the communication tools you 
need once you get one. The curriculum is a little long and goes really in depth
in some areas and it can be hard to be motivated to finish it, but it's stil good. <br />

<a href="https://css-tricks.com/">CSS Tricks</a><br />
Summary: <br />
CSS Tricks hosts some of the best advice, tips, tricks, code snippets, 
and inspiration for CSS. It also offers tons of articles about everything coding,
 ranging from teaching to "mistakes I made starting out" to new techniques 
 being developed. <br />
Review: <br />
CSS-Tricks is probably the best resource for CSS, which it should be 
because that is all it specializes in. If you want to learn anything 
new about CSS, this is definitely the place. <br />

<a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/">Geeks for Geeks</a><br />
Summary: <br />
GeeksforGeeks is a leading platform that provides computer science resources 
and coding challenges for programmers and technology enthusiasts, along with
 interview and exam preparations for upcoming aspirants. GfG also offers qualified

Review: <br />
GeeksforGeeks isn't my go to, but if I need interview help or practice for an
upcoming coding test, this is my go to. The blog also offers the opportunity 
to interact with the community, whether that is to ask questions or speak your mind.<br />
